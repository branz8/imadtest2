MY HISTORICAL CELEBRITY APPLICATION

Introduction:
The historical celebrity app is an app that helps users find celebrities similar to the age that they enter into our app. It is an informative app that can teach everyone something they didn't know about different historical celebrities.
Purpose:
My app that I created has many purposes but there is one main purpose it serves. That main purpose is to find a celebrity that you have a similar age to. This can help people in many different ways. It can help people gain information on the age and death of different celebrities . It also tells the use about information about the celebrity such as what they are famous for and how they passed on.

Purpose of the apps features:
While creating the application I tried to make it as user friendly as possibly. I kept functions and buttons to a minimum as there are only two buttons to avoid confusions. I also use famous celebrities that many people may already know but not know further information about the celebrities so it makes the experience more enjoyable since they will also be gaining knowledge during their experience. It can also encourage learners and students to want to use our app so they can continue to learn. I kept the User interface design fitting to the theme of history hence the scroller in the background that usually represent an ancient or historical era. I used colours such as orange and yellow that represent a treasure or gold because treasure represents ancient times. 


Process while making the application:
There was much thought and effort put into creating the app and I followed many steps in order to achieve my main goal. First before doing anything, I went straight to my notepad to start planning how to get to my destination. I started with the planning of my User Interface design and how I was going to make it welcoming to they user and how I was going to make it fit the historical and ancient theme. This is how I came about with the orange and yellow theme. After this, I started thinking off easy ways to make the app as easy as possible to use for users so I kept the complications to a minimum. I used I enter bar, two buttons which being an enter button and a clear button and an answer bar where your response will be displayed. I changed the size and colours of the different fonts to make it most appealing for the user. After all my UI designing was done and my detailing was complete, it was time for the main building of the app, the coding. I first started with the declarations. After giving my widgets id's I started by declaring my enter button and my clear button and then my two text bars. I had to be very careful and clear with my id's so I got the smoothest process of declaring. After this I decided to make my buttons programmable and functionable using the command setOnClickListener. It's important to get this step correctly otherwise the buttons would not be interactable and your entire app would not be functionalbe. Next, I started coding out my strings regarding the age variables and the different responses. After this I had to start giving ranges of different ages and give a different celebrity for the app to respond to according to the age entered. I went in ranges of 10 and gave the code famous celebrities that some people may recognize so it makes the experience more exciting. While entering the name of the celebrity, I also added what they were famous for so it adds more information with the experience. As I did that, I slowly implemented my if and else statements to make the application more flexible with it's responses and how advanced it is. I had to be precise with my if and else statements so that the application has a variety of answers to give the user and this can also play a part in adding an interesting experience for the user because it wouldn't be fun if the answers were repetitive for the user. Lastly I cleared up all my errors that my code consisted of and corrected all my bracket spacings. Here is where I found majority of my errors because I had brackets missing in some places and also had extra brackets that were out of place.


 


Testing the application out:
After all the coding, it was time to test the app out. During the test, I found a few faults in a few places but after many trial and errors, I eventually got the application to run smoothly doing what it was coded to do without any difficulties.


Difficulties while making my application:
While creating the app, I found myself having obstacles quite often. To aid myself, I resolved to using Google and other forms of help such as reddit, YouTube and smaller websites such as "AskCodi" and "Codeium". I used YouTube videos from YouTube channels like "Caleb Curry" and "Tech Raj". I went to YouTube when I found difficulties in the if and else statements and in some of my declarations. When I came across more difficulties, I looked towards outside in person help. I have a cousin who is a IT specialists and he explained to me how if and else statements. I found this easier than resolving to YouTube videos and websites because it was in person help and he knew how to teach me

The role GitHub played in making my application:
GitHub played a massive part in the making of my application . From the moment I started the creation of my app, I referred to GitHub for everything. GitHub is an application that provides you a wide range of developer tools that can greatly help you in creating and making software and applications. It helps you track your progress and identifies your errors for you. It recommends ways form you to correct your errors. GitHub helps you keep all your work in an organized condition while working with your project. While doing my application, everytime I was done with my work for a day, I saved my progress on GitHub. I not only used GitHub to store my code and use it to correct my errors but I also used it as a way to learn. I referred to many similar examples on GitHub to guide my code since I am a beginner in GitHub was also helpful because I was able to work on different projects simultaneously. GitHub provided me with all types of assistance and wasn't short in giving me responses. I managed to get help from different computer experts on the application and all the assistance contributed to the success of my application.
 



Conclusion:
 Overall I think my application is a success. It is an app literally any human can turn to to gain information. It did take much effort but with all the external assistance, I managed to achieve my goals. I hope many people turn to my app and use it to educate themselves as alot of my time went into making this app ass helpful and user friendly as possible .
